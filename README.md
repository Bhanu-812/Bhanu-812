# Improving Face Recognition in the Wild for InsightFace Model

## Overview

This project aims to enhance the performance of the InsightFace model for face recognition in real-world scenarios, often referred to as "in the wild" conditions. By employing various image processing techniques, we strive to improve the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems, enabling them to handle diverse and challenging environments more effectively.
